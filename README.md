I’m not sure what you are looking for— what you consider a good candidate for your program.

I am nothing like the women who are the public face of ADA… I am not young and sleek, I don’t have a college degree, I don’t hold a high power position and I have no programming experience.

I feel like the only chance I have to be accepted to your program is to make a humanitarian plea.

I am dangerously desperate to escape my current job.

For the past several years I have averaged 50-60 hours per week— I have a lot of responsibility but absolutely no authority and no opportunity for advancement.

I am stuck and the long hours are an insurmountable barrier to further education.

I am smart and creative and completely burnt out.

I applied for the spring session, and was really psyched about the chance to escape my dead-end job and be able to turn my life completely around within a year’s time.

I started daydreaming about what it would be like to work in a less stressful environment with creative, supportive co-workers... did I mention that I tend towards naivety?

When I got the flush email, it was a gut-punch.

I decided that I would try again.

I bought a laptop with my income tax refund and a couple books on programming.

I intended to make a concerted effort to leave work earlier and spend a couple hours each night working on the computer… but my workload got in the way.  

I had the idea of lobbying a couple local Tacoma companies to see if I could find someone to sponsor me with ADA… but that idea never got off the ground.

This week I contemplated flash.

I have a friend who’s tight with Steve Ballmer and I considered asking him to ask Mr. Ballmer to be one of my online recommendations… gauche as it sounds, I gave it some consideration.

I know this application isn’t all that special— but I have 2 strong supporters who want me to be accepted by ADA and have already submitted recommendations for me— otherwise I probably would have given up. 

If you have room for me you will change my life— and I will strive to be a credit to your program.
 
I’ll get off the couch now— my 45-minutes are about up.
